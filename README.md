# golangProjects
All projects and excercises teaching myself GO.
CS 499 with Dr. Elliot Forbes in Spring 2023. The 2 books im using are: 
<i>Get Programming with GO</i> (for excercises) 
and
<i>The Go Programming Language</i> (for refrence)

## Things that supprised me in the GO Programming Language
* No type coercion. int + float produces compiler error
* How strings worked with utf-8
